        <h1>Dylan Benner</h1>
        <h2>Graphic Designer</h2>

        <p>Born in Philadelphia, raised in the raleigh area, I have come to love and enjoy this area in the time that I have lived here. I grew up primarily in Holly Springs going through elementary through high school in the area. Since then I have found a passion in Art and Graphic Design. I have been attending wake tech for the past 4 years getting 1 associates, 1 certificate, and working on my second associates degree. I plan on continuing my studies in hopes to find a job in the graphic design field.  </p>
        <p>I personally love working with Adobe Photoshop and InDesign but have recently found alot of enjoyment with Illustrator as its the one that I have struggled with for the longest time and only recently have found myself of higher standing when using it. I also like working with my hands so Adobe Capture has become a great help to alot of my recent designs with getting it to look just the way I want it to as I have alot more control over movement with my hands then on a computer. I think that overall I am well versed in most Adobe programs.</p>
